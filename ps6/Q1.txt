The goal of the simulation is to test the components of normal mixture distribution. They use fisher information matrices to assess their method. The way they approach called minium information ratio estimation and validation, which is based on the ratio of fisher information matrices that build with unknown to known.\\

The author has choosen EM algorithm to use maximum likelihood method to obtain 100 sets of parameters. The sample were generated from standard normal distribution. Those values and sample sizes that used to generate null sample may impact the result.Also, maybe the way proportion, distance measures and setting of mean and variance will impact the outcomes. Maybe the author should consider more about difference variance of the two components(not sure)\\

Those tables reveal enough information for the test results. For table 1, personally, I would recommend transfer the row into columns and combine the result of inadjusted test and adjusted test to compare the result more intutive. I would even calcuate the difference of powers.\\

The results makes more sense when sample size increase and D value decrease.\\

In my view, more simulation would be more powerful for the hyopetheis.Size of 10 might not strong enough. Most of the case, the size should at least be 100 to be representive, and not exceed 1000 for the efficency. (general 10% of the population)\\
